# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute!

If this is your first Pull Request, then watching this
[**How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on Github**](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
by Kent C. Dodds is very helpful.

## Project setup

_No additional setup is required for it to be working_

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Setup your nvim config to use your local java-util.nvim installation

Example:

```lua
-- plugins.lua

return require("packer").startup(function(use)
  local function use_local(plugin)
    local home = os.getenv("HOME")
    use(string.format("%s/dev/plugins/%s", home, plugin))
  end

  use_local("java-util.nvim")
end)
```

3. Run `make test` to validate that all is well
4. Create a new branch with `git checkout -b (feature|docs|fix|...etc)/<branch-name>`

## Running tests

Our tests utilize snapshot testing. These snapshots can be generated by running `make snapshots` or a specific one `sh ./scripts/build-snapshot.sh $JAVA_BUILDER_CLASS $LUA_BUILDER_FILE`

To correctly validate that everything is still working fine, make sure to generate them before running the tests.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated automatically from function header documentation. This is made possible by using a treesitter grammar created by [TJ](https://github.com/tjdevries).

For information about how to correctly write documentation checkout [this guide](https://github.com/tjdevries/tree-sitter-lua/blob/master/HOWTO.md)

When pushing changes to the docs, they are automatically generated during a ci pipeline.

Ones they are generated they will be pushed to your current branch, so you can see the changes.

If the documentation was not exactly what you wanted, you can do `git commit --amend` and `git push --force` to remove the github ci commit again
